# about
In this repo I organize parts of python code that are of interest to me. org-format is used as generator as it allows me to tangle Python-files from emacs from where I do my version control too. The python-files in this repo are exported from this file.
The github-repo itself is set to public for convenience and not for suggesting usage or expectations about contentual stability.
